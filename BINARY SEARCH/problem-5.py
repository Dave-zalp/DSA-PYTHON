# Peak Element Finder
# You are given an array of integers where no two adjacent elements are equal.
# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
# Write a function to find the index of any one peak element.
# The array may contain multiple peaks, and the function should return the index of one of them. Assume a peak element always exists.

# nums = [12,7,5,4,19,3]
# [4] because 19 has the index 4 in the array
